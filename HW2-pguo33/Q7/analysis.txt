1. Ease to develop (for developers)
       Python: Medium for plotting. Require experiences with different module to develop more effectively. 
       Tableau: Easy to build graphs without coding. Database and server support available.
       D3: Difficult as most components need intensive coding. Need experience to get familiar with the use of attributes while coding with them.

2. Ease to maintain the visualization for developers (e.g., difficulty of the maintenance of the product as the requirements change, the data changes, the hosting platform changes, etc.)
       Python: Medium since built-in visualization libraries have friendly API for building powerful visualization
       Tableau: Easy due to friendly drag and drop UI for modifying data pipelines and dashboards 
       D3: Difficult to maintain if code is inefficient as it can be difficult to interpret 

3. Usability of visualization developed for end users
       Python: Medium. Especially easy for the visualization of calculations and scientific simulations.
       Tableau: Difficult to communicate with end users with only picture files.
       D3: Easy to use with available source code.

4. Scalability of visualization to "large" datasets
       Python: Medium, requires external tools (Hadoop, AWS) to scale effectively. And it is not efficient in computing and running rate.
       Tableau: Easy scalability due to built-in data/web server features, but sometimes it is difficult to manage with too many parameters involved.
       D3: Appropriate for large datasets with simple operation such as packing parameters in a single function.

5. System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing) for end users
       Python: Python compiler, or some IDEs, free.
       Tableau: Licensed software, charge.
       D3: Compiler or IDEs as well, and also browsers (Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.).
